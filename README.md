## 🙏 Acknowledgement
We would like to express our gratitude to Ma’am Fatima, our professor in CS1203, for her guidance and support in our project. Because of her, we were able to understand how to code using object-oriented programming, and we gained a deeper understanding of it. Without her help, we wouldn't have been able to complete this project.

We also want to thank our groupmates—without your cooperation, this project wouldn't have been possible either. Thank you for working together and helping shape the concept of our Furniture Workshop. We truly appreciate it.
